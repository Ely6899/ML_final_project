what are the most similair countries?
what are the most different countries?
what attributes usually are in images outside thier clustering?
questions that confusion matrix usually answers:
1. what countries are most confused?
2. what country has the best preservibilty?
what is the avg color in each country? what results such an algorithm recieve?
what are most important and less-importanat features in image for classification(using NN)?
dataset1: images datatset2: vector vgg embeddings
svm abilities on both(per example: all models required)

how does neural nets help us in assuming the data?
pca-bad, vgg+pca- improvement in closness between embeddings?
